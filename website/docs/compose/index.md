# Working with Compose

Podman Desktop supports the [Compose specification](https://compose-spec.io), and can:

1. [Set up Compose](/docs/compose/setting-up-compose).
1. [Manage multi-container applications defined in Compose files](/docs/compose/running-compose).

Podman Desktop displays the multi-container applications that Compose creates as a container group.
