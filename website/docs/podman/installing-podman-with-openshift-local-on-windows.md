# Installing the Podman Preset with OpenShift Local on Windows

On Windows, running the Podman container engine requires running a Linux distribution on a virtual machine.

Consider installing the Podman Preset in OpenShift Local rather than [installing Podman with Podman Desktop](/docs/podman/installing) when you require one of following:

- No WSL 2
- Full control on the HyperV virtual machine
- User without administrator privileges
- VPN
- Windows 10

#### Prerequisites

- The user is a member of the _Hyper-V Administrators_ group. The user can add a virtual machine, start or stop this virtual machine, and access the resources related to this virtual machine.
- Windows 10 version 1709 or later, Enterprise or Professional edition, or Windows 11, Enterprise or Professional edition

#### Procedure

1. Install the OpenShift Local extension.

1. Install OpenShift Local.

1. Select the Podman container runtime preset:

   ```shell-session
   $ crc config set preset podman
   ```

1. Set up your host machine for Red Hat OpenShift Local:

   ```shell-session
   $ crc setup
   ```

1. Start the Red Hat OpenShift instance:

   ```shell-session
   $ crc start
   ```
