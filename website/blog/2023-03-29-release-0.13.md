## Release details

### Update to Podman v4.4.4

Podman Desktop 0.13 embeds [Podman 4.4.4](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases/tag/v4.4.4) in
Windows and macOS installers [#1456](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1456).

### Compose support

You can install Docker Compose from the Podman Desktop UI [#1578](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1578). This will allow you use Compose workflows using Podman.

### Extensions

To make it easier to extend Podman Desktop we have:

- Published the [Podman Desktop Extension API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@podman-desktop/api) to npmjs [#1727](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1727)
- Documented [how to create, publish, and install your own extensions](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/extensions)
- Expanded the API for `QuickPickInput` [#1839](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1839)

### UI and UX improvements

#### Welcome page [#1726](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1726)

The first time every user starts Podman Desktop, they will see a welcome page:

![welcome-page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19958075/225682776-e016ba31-5bb9-41d5-87ed-f93caeb3fb84.png)

Note that the Welcome page will only appear the first time you run Podman Desktop 0.13.0, and none of your settings or assets in Podman Desktop will be affected by it.
Over time, this page will be expanded to help with initial setup and configuration.

#### New Task Manager [#1724](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1724)

A new Task Manager has been added to the status bar to see the progress (or return to) long running tasks. To start with, building images [#1725](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1725) and Podman machine [#1742](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1742) are using the task manager.

#### Updated Resources Settings [#1582](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1582)

The **<Icon icon="fa-solid fa-cog" size="lg" /> Settings > Resources** page has been updated with a new design, making it easier to see and control your providers from a single place.

The other settings pages have been updated for consistency with this new design.

#### Update Alerts [#1827](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/1827)

A new alert button will appear in the status bar when future updates are available.
