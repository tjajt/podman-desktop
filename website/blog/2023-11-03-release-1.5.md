### Enhancements to the Settings area

The user experience for enabling or disabling Docker compatibility is improved, with a new entry in the **<Icon icon="fa-solid fa-cog" size="lg" />Settings > Preferences** screen that includes contextual guidance. [#4093](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4093)

<ReactPlayer playing controls url="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/270497318-902b2566-62ad-4ee6-87af-6a9a2705de99.mov" width='100%' height='100%' />

### Extension API improvements

The ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop extension API received many improvements, including:

- In addition to pushing and listing image from an extension, it's now possible to pull images from a ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop extension [#4155](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4155)

- The ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop extension API has been enhanced with both the ability to list images &amp; networks and the ability to create containers &amp; networks. [#4172](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4172)

- ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop extensions now have a consistent way to run administrative tasks. [#4049](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4049)

- Extensions now have the ability to register a custom Kubernetes config generator. [#3970](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3970)

- The ability of extensions to add commands to UI menus has been extended; previously for action menus it was only available in the Image list screen. It is now possible for extensions to add commands to the action menus of items listed on the Containers list screen as well. [#3947](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3947) &amp; [#3963](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3963)

- Extensions have gained the ability to contribute menu items in the UI based on specific conditions. [#3959](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3959)

- Enhanced logic for displaying or hiding properties listed under the **<Icon icon="fa-solid fa-cog" size="lg" />Settings > Preferences** screens is now available. [#4159](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4159)

<ReactPlayer playing controls url="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6422176/271650937-3991565c-12a4-4e6c-a315-9343bfa25f65.mov" width='100%' height='100%' />

## Other Notable Enhancements

- The progress of loading an image into Kind is now visible as a task in the task manager. [#4061](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4061)

![kind-progress-task](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42176370/270154775-eb7007b4-fd0e-4287-be9e-40ffc412de35.png)

- It's now possible to start a new Podman machine right after creation, or you can create it and wait to start it later. It's up to you! [#4046](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4046)

![podman-start-now-or-later](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49404737/269941187-f4768833-ecfc-4d0b-8acf-d4afedb428d9.png)

- The Podman machine and Kubernetes provider creation forms have an updated look & feel consisted with other forms in the user interface, along with minor bug fixes. [#4317](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4317)

![Updated provider creation forms](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19958075/274694157-fe89f3bc-e5b8-4735-96e9-669fe52c7a41.png)

- The empty screen message shown when a search filter results in no matches now provides a message specific to filter matching, including the specific filter terms and an explicit button for clearing the filter. Previously, the screen displayed a generic message about how to create new objects of the type displayed on the screen, which led to some confusion about the status of the system. [#3988](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3988)

<ReactPlayer playing controls url="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19958075/269291090-13e724f7-252f-4915-bb04-00665001d21d.mov" width='100%' height='100%' />

- New support for adding spin animations to icons is now available. [#4188](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4188)

- There is a new indeterminate progress bar type available for the task manager; this is meant for providing limited status for actions whose APIs do not provide detailed status information. [#4016](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4016)

- For authenticating as admin to perform administrative tasks, ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop now provides touchID support for macOS. [#4050](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4050)

![touchID-support](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/248588015-f08115bd-d211-43ad-bddd-286d7b3a7056.png)

<ReactPlayer playing controls url="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/436777/269859758-47581e2b-8469-4e9c-822c-f4fddf46684d.mp4" width='100%' height='100%' />

- Support for connecting to interactive terminals for containers via tty was added. [#3900](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3900)

- It's now more clear which container/pod providers will autostart when ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop starts. Previously autostart had both a global and a per-provider setting. It has been simplified by removing the global setting. [#3840](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3840)

- The "Working with containers" section of the documentation has been reworked and improved. [#3951](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3951)

## Notable Bug Fixes

- The disable registry command was not blocking subsequent pulls from disabled registries. This has been corrected. [#4183](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4183)

- Some users behind network proxies were unable to complete workflow involving the download of online resources. The mechanism for fetching these resources has been fixed to be proxy compatible to address this issue. [#3994](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3994)

- The status of pods running in Kubernetes that are undergoing the deletion process is now accurately reflected in the ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop UI. [#3877](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3877)

- The image details page always listed the image as being "not used" even when it was. This has been corrected. [#3985](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3985)

- Previously, deleting a specific image tag would cause all tags with the same Image ID to be deleted. This has been fixed so only the selected image tag will be deleted. [#3837](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3837)

- Could not view the pod details for some remote Kubernetes cluster pods due to an encoding error. [#4371](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4371)

- Error logs were being tracked separately from the actions they applied to. This has been addressed for kind cluster creation failure [#4427](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4427) and Compose installation failure [#4407](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4407).

- For Linux users, ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop previously did not appear under the "Development" menu when installed via Flatpak; it appeared under "Utilities." ðŸ¦­ Podman Desktop now appears under the "Development" menu. [#3911](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3911)

- Podman Machine names are no longer prefixed with the "Podman Machine" string. [#3878](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3878)

![touchID-support](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19958075/267378447-aafdfbd7-f005-4b94-8626-9e11eec61b95.png)

- The initial action state of pods and containers was being displayed as "STARTING" regardless of actual state; this has been corrected. [#3889](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3889)

- Resizing the application window no longer makes the last lines of a container's terminal invisible. [#3993](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3993)

- An issue with incorrect terminal behavior in response to long lines in the terminal attached to a container has been resolved. [#3955](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/3955)

- A spacing issue on the run image form has been corrected. [#4089]https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4089

- The "podify" icon & button on the Containers list was unusually large in release 1.4. That regression has been corrected in this release. [#4122](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4122)

- An error in the instructions for Windows users on migrating from Docker has been corrected. [#4157](https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4157)
