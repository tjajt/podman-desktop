# Release process for Podman Desktop

## Pre-requisites

- Create Enhancement Issue `Release vX.X.X` for current sprint, then update the label to `kind/release` and assign it to yourself.
- Confirm with Podman Desktop maintainers that pending / need-to-go-in PR's have been merged.
- Notify main contributors on Discord / Slack.
- Release notes for the blog: Communicate with the person who has been tasked with creating the documentation. If you are assigned, see the below "Documentation" section.

In the below example, we will pretend that we're upgrading from `0.11.0` to `0.12.0`. Please use the CORRECT release numbers as these are just example numbers.

## Release timeline

Below is what a typical release week may look like:

- **Monday (Notify):** 48-hour notification. Communicate to maintainers and public channels a release will be cut on Wednesday and to merge any pending PRs. Inform QE team. Start work on blog post as it is usually the longest part of the release process.
- **Tuesday (Staging, Testing & Blog):** Stage the release (see instructions below) to create a new cut of the release to test. Test the pre-release (master branch) build briefly. Get feedback from committers (if applicable). Push the blog post for review (as it usually takes a few back-and-forth reviews on documentation).
- **Wednesday (Release):** Cut the new release using the below release process. The release will take 24 hours for release to hit all release channels (Flatpak, Brew, Chocolatey, etc.). We aim to have a release out _by Thursday_ so we do not have any surprises leading into the weekend.
- **Thursday (Post-release Testing & Blog):** Test the post-release build briefly for any critical bugs. Confirm that new release has been pushed to all release channels. Push the blog post live. Get a known issues list together from QE and publish to the Podman Desktop Discussions, link to this from the release notes.
- **Friday (Communicate):** Friday is statistically the best day for new announcements. Post on internal channels. Post on reddit, hackernews, twitter, etc.

## Releasing on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/actions/workflows/release.yaml
1. Click on the top right drop-down menu `Run workflow`
1. Enter the name of the release. Example: `0.12.0` (DO NOT use the v prefix like v0.12.0)
1. Specify the branch to use for the new release. It's main for all major releases. For a bugfix release, you'll select a different branch.
1. Click on the `Run workflow` button.
1. Note: `Run workflow` takes approximately 30-50 minutes. Brew a coffee, work on the release notes, and/or complete the next two steps while you wait.
1. Close the milestone for the respective release, make sure that all tasks within the milestone are completed / updated before closing. https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/milestones
1. If not already created, click on `New Milestone` and create a new milestone for the NEXT release.
1. Check that https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/actions/workflows/release.yaml has been completed. Sometimes it will flake, so you may need to re-run it.
1. There should be an automated PR that has been created. Approve this and set to auto-merge. This will be automatically merged in after all tests have been ran (takes 10-30 minutes). The title looks like `chore: üì¢ Bump version to 0.13.0`. Rerun workflow manually if some of e2e tests are failing.
1. Above PR MUST be merged before continuing with the steps.
1. Edit the new release https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/releases/edit/v0.12.0
1. Select previous tag (v0.11.0) and click on `Generate release notes` and the click on `Update release`

## Test release before it is rolling out.

The release is a pre-release, it means it is not yet the latest version, so no clients will automatically update to this version.

It allows QE (and everyone else) to test these binaries before they go live or are in the package managers.

At this step, generates as well Flathub pull request so people can test the package from the builders of the pull request.

## Next phase

- ‚ùå All severe bugs and regressions are investigated and discussed. If we agree any should block the release, need to fix the bugs and do a respin of the release with a new .z release like 1.3.1 instead of 1.3.0.

Create a branch if it does not exist. For example 1.3.x if 1.3.0 failed. Then, cherry-pick bugfixes in that branch.

- ‚úÖ If committers agree we have a green light, proceed. **Do not forget to change the release from 'pre-release' to 'latest release' before proceeding**.
